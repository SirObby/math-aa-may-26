  \section{Scatter diagram}
  Scatter diagram is relationship of x and y variables like weight, height, time.\\
  - plot x and y.\\
  Example.\\
  Start with list, enter data.\\
  Then open Data and stats.\\
  A general upwards trend shows \textbf{a positive correlation}, y increases as x increases.\\
  A general trend downwards shows \textbf{a negative correlation}, y decreases as x increases.\\
  Trend can also be with \textbf{non-correlation} at all.\\
  A strong correlation means that points are close to line.\\
  A weak correlation has point far away from a line.\\
  And moderate correlation is somewhere inbetween.\\
  Causation is not correlation.\\
  Correlations are always linear.\\

  C) Strong association positive relationship correlation, linear.\\
  D) Moderate association negative relationship correlation, linear.\\
